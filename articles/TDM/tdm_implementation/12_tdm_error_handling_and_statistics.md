# TDM Error Handling and Statistics Flows

The TDM library has a generic Error Handling and Statistics Gathering mechanism based on Broadway capabilities that can be tailored for TDM business requirements. 

The mechanism includes a set of generic flows that gather errors and statistics during task execution and populates them into dedicated tables. This data is used for monitoring  TDM tasks and creating TDM execution reports.

### How Do I Perform Error Handling in TDM?

The TDM library includes two utility flows that handle errors during the execution of TDM tasks:

* PopulateTableErrorsWithFailed.flow
* PopulateTableErrorsWithReject.flow

Both utilities invoke the internal **PopulateTableErrors.flow** to populate data on errors into the **task_exe_error_detailed** table. The difference between the utilities is that PopulateTableErrorsWithFailed.flow is set on a session level:

~~~
ENTITY_STATUS = failed 
~~~

PopulateTableErrorsWithFailed.flow also sets the error category as *Entity Failed* in the **task_exe_error_detailed** table, while PopulateTableErrorsWithReject.flow sets a record as *Record Rejected*.

The error handling utility is invoked from each Load flow's **Load Data To Target** Stage. An error is suppressed in order to continue a task execution in the middle and to gather statistics.

By default, the **PopulateTableErrorsWithFailed.flow** is invoked. If a record rejection is needed instead of failing an entire entity, replace the Inner flow name with **PopulateTableErrorsWithReject.flow**.

### How Do I Gather Statistics in TDM?

The TDM library includes the PopulateTableStats.flow that gathers statistics during a TDM task execution:

PopulateTableStats.flow populates statistics data into the **task_exe_stats_detailed** table, including the number of records in the source and target tables. 

PopulateTableStats.flow is invoked from each Load flow's **Get Statistics** Stage to gather statistics and the **Report Statistics** Stages to be loaded into the TDM DB tables.

# TDM Generic Broadway Flows


The Fabric TDM library has built-in generic Broadway flows that can be easily adapted for TDM for each specific data model. This article describes the generic flows that are available in a project after the [TDM Library](04_fabric_tdm_library.md) is imported. 

## Broadway Flows and Templates

The **TDM** folder in the Broadway Shared Objects folder includes generic flows that can be used for TDM execution in several Logical Units. These flows handle activities like setting global variables and sync mode, loading a reference, handling errors, populating execution statistics and do not require manual updates.

The **Templates** folder holds the flows used for creating DELETE and LOAD flows. Since the flows receive the Logical Unit name as an input parameter, they can be run several times for each LU.

The following discuss the structure and functionality of some generic flows.

### Initialization

TDM task initialization is performed using the **InitiateTDMLoad.flow** utility which includes several steps like:

* Setting the values of global variables in a session and sync mode.
* Setting the source environment based on the task's source before getting the LUI.
* Getting the LUI from Fabric.
* Setting the target environment as a preparation step for Delete and Load.

The **InitiateTDMLoad.flow** is performed as the first step of the **TDMOrchestrator.flow** task's flow.

### Reference

The TDM library includes a set of flows that handle reference data.

### Load and Delete Generic Flows

The TDM library holds templates and generic flows that can used to create a TDM implementation based on a project's data model. The templates are built using the Fabric [Templates](/articles/35_templates/01_templates_overview.md) functionality which enables creating different project objects based on a predefined structure.

### Error Handling and Statistics

The TDM library offers a generic error handling and statistics gathering mechanism, based on Broadway capabilities tailored for TDM business requirements.

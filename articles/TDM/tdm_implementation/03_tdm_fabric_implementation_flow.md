# TDM - Fabric Implementation Overview

 Implementation of the TDM  in Fabric involves several steps. The following illustration displays the main ones:

A Fabric TDM project has the following:

- TDM Utilities, TDM Web Services and [TDM LU](04_fabric_tdm_library.md#tdm-lu).
- Logical Units, TDM entities and their related data are modeled into LUs like Customer, Billing, Ordering, etc.
- Broadway flows that are defined under each LU to delete or load entities from the target environment.
- Environment setup, defining the source and target environments of the TDM. Setting the connection details of interfaces and the Globals in each environment.

K2view offers a TDM library with TDM utilities as well as TDM Templates for Broadway flows. These utilities must be implemented by the TDM Fabric project.

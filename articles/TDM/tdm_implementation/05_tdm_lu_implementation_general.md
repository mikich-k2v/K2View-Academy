# TDM LU Implementation - Generic Guidelines

A TDM task copies a [Business Entity](/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/03_business_entity_overview.md) (BE) from a source environment to a target environment. A BE can have multiple [LUs](/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md) with a flat or a hierarchical structure. For example, a Customer BE can consist of Customer Care, Billing, Ordering and Usage LUs. The ability to break a BE up into several LUs enables maximum flexibility and avoiding duplicate development. In addition, defining a hierarchical structure of parent-child LUs enables creating LUs based on the natural root entity of the related data sources instead of forcefully setting unified root entities on all LUs related to a given BE.

Each LU in a TDM project must have additional components to support TDM functionality.  

## Basic LU Structure

Each LU in a TDM project has the following structure:

- Dummy root table, FABRIC_TDM_ROOT. 

- Generic TDM LU tables that are linked to the root table. 

- Two main branches that are linked to the root table -

  - **Source branch**, LU tables that extract an entity's source data. Source LU tables are populated when a TDM task needs to load (insert) entities to a target environment and therefore must extract the source data of these entities.

  - **Target branch**, LU tables that extract the target keys of an entity. The keys are extracted from the target environment to enable deleting an entity from a target environment if required by the TDM task.

### Step 1 - Copy the Objects from the TDM_LIBRARY LU into Each LU

Import the [TDM_LIBRARY LU](/articles/TDM/tdm_implementation/04_fabric_tdm_library.md#tdm_library-lu) from the **TDM Library** to your project and copy the LU level objects in the TDM_LIBRARY to your LU.

### Step 2 - Add the TDM Root Table and the Generic TDM Tables to the LU Schema

1. Add the **FABRIC_TDM_ROOT** LU table to the LU Schema and set it as a [Root table](/articles/03_logical_units/08_define_root_table_and_instance_ID_LU_schema.md). 
2.  Set the **Instance PK** column to **k2_tdm_eid** and verify that the **fnCheckInsFound** enrichment function under Shared Objects is attached to the LU table. 
    This function validates that the entity (IID) exists in the main source LU tables if the TDM task inserts the entity to the target, and therefore must extract its data from the data source. If the validation fails and entity is not found in the source table, the entity is rejected. 
3. Add the **LU_PARAMS** and  **INSTANCE_TABLE_COUNT**, **TDM_LU_TYPE_RELATION_EID** and **TDM_LU_TYPE_REL_TAR_EID** to the LU Schema and link the tables to the **FABRIC_TDM_ROOT.IID**.
4. In Parent LUs, add the **TDM_LU_TYPE_RELATION_EID** and **TDM_LU_TYPE_REL_TAR_EID** relationship tables to the LU Schema and link the tables to the **FABRIC_TDM_ROOT.IID**.

4. Add the LU_PARAMS LU table to each LU Schema (also when it is not required for defining LU parameters) whereby the LU_PARAM table only holds the ENTITY_ID and SOURCE_ENVIRONMENT fields.

5. Edit **trnLuParams** and **LU_PARAMS** to enable a subset of entities from selected parameters for this LU. 

   Click for more information about [Handling TDM Parameters](07_tdm_implementation_parameters_handling.md).

6. Mask sensitive data in LU tables using a Broadway population and the [Masking Actor](/articles/19_Broadway/actors/07_masking_and_sequence_actors.md). 

   Click for more information about [TDM Masking].

### Step 3 - Add the Source LU Tables to the LU Schema

1. Link the main source LU tables to the FABRIC_TDM_ROOT table. 

2. Verify that the main source LU tables are also populated in [ROOT_TABLE_NAME Global](/articles/TDM/tdm_implementation/04_fabric_tdm_library.md#globals).

3. Create the population of the main source LU tables based on the [Root function](/articles/07_table_population/11_1_creating_or_editing_a_root_function.md).  

4. Edit the Root functions generated for the LU tables based on the **fnPop_RootTable** function under the [TDM_LIBRARY LU](04_fabric_tdm_library.md#tdm_library-lu):
   
   - Copy the code of the **fnPop_RootTable** into the newly generated Root function of the LU table.
   
   - Edit the **String sql** variable to include the DB query on the DB table.

   - Edit the **db parameter** of the **fetch** command.
   
   - Example:
   
     ```java
     	String sql = "SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, SSN, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME FROM main.CUSTOMER where customer_id = ?";
     	db("CRM_DB").fetch(sql, input).each(row->{
     		yield(row.cells());
     	});
     ```
   
5. The updated Root function populates the main source LU table under the following conditions:

   - The TDM task loads (inserts) the entities to the target environment.
   - The user does not set the Override Sync Mode to avoid synchronizing the entities from the source.  

   Click to view the [Override Sync Mode Summary Table](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/04_task_execution_overridden_parameters.md#overriding-the-sync-mode-on-the-task-execution).

6. As a result, if the Sync mode is set to **Do not sync** by the user, or the task is a [delete only](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/19_load_task_request_parameters_regular_mode.md#delete-entity-without-load) task, the source LU tables are not populated by the LUI sync.

7. Link the remaining source LU tables to the main LU tables so that if the main source LU table is not populated. The remaining source LU table also remains empty.

### Step 4 - Add the Target LU Tables to the LU Schema

1. Define the LU tables to extract the target keys to enable deleting an entity from the target.

2. Link the main target LU table to the FABRIC_TDM_ROOT table.

3. Add the **fnDecisionDeleteFromTarget** Decision function to the main target LU tables. Note that this Decision function is under Shared Objects and is imported from the [TDM Library](04_fabric_tdm_library.md).

4. Link the remaining target LU tables to the main target LU table.

### LU Debug

The LUI must include the source environment which must be set as the [active environment](/articles/25_environments/01_environments_overview.md) in Fabric. When running a [Data Viewer](/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/01_data_viewer.md) on the LU to debug its implementation, do either:

- Populate the source environment of the LUI using `_dev_`.  For example, **_dev_1**.
- Create and deploy the environment to the Fabric Debug server, set the source environment as an active environment in the Fabric Debug server and populate the deployed environment name in the LUI. For example, **UAT_1**.

# Task Window - Reference Tab

The **General tab** in the Extract and Load Task window displays the **Reference** setting. The following options are available:

- **None**, default value. Do not include Reference tables in the task.
- **Reference Only**, create a task to process Reference tables only. Do not include entities in the task.
- **Both - reference and entities**, create and process both entities and Reference tables.

When selecting **Reference Only** or **Both - reference and entities** modes the **Reference** tab is added to the Task window.   

Extract tasks extract **Reference tables** from a source environment and store them in the **Cassandra DB**.  Load tasks select data in Reference tables from the Cassandra DB and load them to the target environment.

Unlike LUIs, a Load task does not activate an extraction from the source environment. Therefore, Reference tables must be loaded into Cassandra by the Extract task before loading them to the target.

## Reference Tab - Extract Task

Display a list of all Reference tables defined in [trnRefList](articles/TDM/tdm_implementation/04_fabric_tdm_library.md#trnreflist) Fabric translation object for the task's LUs. The Reference tab displays its **Source Interface Name**, **Schema Name** on each table and **LU Name**. You can **Select All**, **Unselect All**, or check a selected list of Reference tables.

The Extract task extracts the selected Reference tables and [saves them into the Cassandra DB](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/05_tdm_%20reference_processes.md#tdm-lu---tdmcopyreftablesfortdm-job). 



## Reference Tab - Load Task

### Regular Mode

Display a list of all Reference tables [extracted into Cassandra for the task's LU and source environment](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/05_tdm_%20reference_processes.md#tdm-lu---tdmcopyreftablesfortdm-job). Similar to the Extract Task window, a Reference tab displays the **Source Interface Name**, **Schema Name**, and the **LU Name** on each table. You can **Select All**, **Unselect All**, or check a selected list of Reference tables.

### Data Flux Mode

Displays the list of available versions created on Reference tables and a source environment, and a load task's LU. The versions created during the last month are displayed. To select another period, edit the **From Date** and **To Date** settings.
